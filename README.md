## About Me 🧑‍💻  
**"Building products that blend intelligence, design, and scale"**

I’m a **Computer Science Engineering (Data Science)** undergraduate at **Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering**, passionate about building **modern, scalable, and visually compelling web applications**.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **frontend engineering, backend systems, and AI-powered products**. From crafting polished React + Tailwind interfaces to designing robust APIs and data models, I focus on delivering **production-ready, maintainable solutions**.

I have hands-on experience across **real-world projects, hackathon solutions, and student-led technical initiatives**, and I’m currently strengthening my foundations in **DSA (Java)** while building full-stack applications using **React, TypeScript, FastAPI, and modern backend stacks**.

💡 I believe great software doesn’t just function — **it communicates, scales, and endures**.
